# Etch-A-Sketch

Forked from: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) Javascript curriculum.

## Description

A fun etch-a-sketch game similar to the toy invented in 1959. The main screen will draw as the mouse moves over it.

I used this project to practice DOM manipulation and using event listeners.

## Features

* Black, random color, and shader modes
* Input grid size to change the size of the drawing stroke
* Shake button to clear the screen
